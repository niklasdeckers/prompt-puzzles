# Prompt Puzzles for Generative Text-To-Image Models üß©üí¨üñåÔ∏èüñºÔ∏è

These puzzle games facilitate research about the interaction of users with generative text-to-image models like Stable
Diffusion when developing prompts.

## Setup

[PyWebIO](https://pywebio.readthedocs.io/) is used to deploy the website frontend and backend. The required Stable
Diffusion backend, which is accessed using `requests`,
is [part of the `stable-diffusion-playground`](https://github.com/niklasdeckers/stable-diffusion-playground/tree/main/backend).

The `index.py` script launches all available games.

The following environment variables must be set:

- `TXT2IMG_BACKEND_URL` is the url of the deployed `stable-diffusion-playground` backend, including port specification.
  Alternatively:
- `TXT2IMG_BACKEND_URLS` is a json list of such urls which will be used as fallbacks.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is a GPT-3 API key, which is used for some applications.

## Components

### [Taboo ü§´](taboo)

The user is asked to describe images while having to avoid some given terms. This is a scenario similar to query
obfuscation, where a user tries to query a search engine while not using certain terms.

### [Portrayal üé®](portrayal)

The user is asked to recreate a given image using a Stable Diffusion prompt. This is a scenario similar to query
refinement. In the end, the generated image is evaluated using given criteria.
